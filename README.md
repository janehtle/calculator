# Calculator Challenge

Functional web browser calculator that performs basic arithmetic calculations. It can add, subtract, divide, and multiply whole and floating integers. AC clears the display in the input bar. 

# Design

The design of the calculator was inspired by the Casio calculator that did basic math and given that it is now considered an "old school" calculator in 2025, the neon and the colors were decided upon as it is one of the designs associated with all things retro or old school.
